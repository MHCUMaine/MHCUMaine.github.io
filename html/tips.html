    <h1>Tips to help communicating your mental health in college</h1>
    <p>It is proven that students will be less likely to communicate their mental health with others if they believe others will respond negatively. <br>Students hinder themselves from reaching out, resulting in a greater mental health struggle. <br>This becomes a cyclical dilemma, which can intensify the challenges students face. <br>However, there is a way to break this cycle. The most effective method to get students to advocate for their own mental health is to destigmatize the process.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>Mental health is a common struggle and it should be demonstrated regularly. <br>The more publicized this problem is, the less of a burden it is for those suffering from it. <br>It's important to know that you are not alone and you can talk to others, share with a friend, family member or mental health counselors.</p>
